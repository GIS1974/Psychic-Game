1. Create variables and set them to zero:
var winsCount = 0;
var lossesCount = 0;
var guessesLeft = 9;
---var guessesSoFar = 0;---

Log variales value to console.

2. Generate random alphabet letter from 'a' to 'z'.
var randomLetter = randomly generated letter.

Log randomLetter to console.

3. Listen to the keyboard input. Show this letter in a string "Your Guesses so far".
After evey keyboard click:
guessesLeft -=1;
guessesSoFar =++;
var userLetter = user typed letter;

Log variables to console.

4. Until guessesLeft > 0
If userLetter = randomLetter -- user wins:
winsCount =++
clear "Your Guesses so far"

else

computer wins
lossesCount =++;
clear "Your Guesses so far".
